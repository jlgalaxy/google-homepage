# google-homepage

Hello and welcome to my Google Homepage Project! 

This is the Google Homepage project I am working on via The Odin Project.
It is far from perfect and may or may not be revisited later in the future.

Image folder contains all the necessary icons and logos for the website.
Index.html contains the HTML.
Styles.css contains the necessary CSS code.
