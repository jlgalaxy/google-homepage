# google-homepage

Hello and welcome to my Google Homepage Project! 

This is the Google Homepage project I am working on via The Odin Project.
It is far from perfect and I intend to return to make it look better.

Image folder contains all the necessary icons and logos for the website.
Index.html contains the HTML.
Styles.css contains the necessary CSS code.
