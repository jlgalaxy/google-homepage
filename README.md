# google-homepage

Hello and welcome to my Google Homepage Project! 

This is the Google Homepage project I am working on via The Odin Project.
It is far from perfect and may or may not be revisited later in the future.
I am working on a 3 month timeline and expect to finish The Odin Project's FullStack Javascript in November.

I'm afraid if I give myself further time, the ship will sail.
See you later in the future, should our paths ever meet.
